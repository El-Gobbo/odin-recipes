# odin-recipes
A recipe website created as part of the Odin Project to practice web developer coding

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated an ability to:
Create HTML pages for a homepage and at least 3 recipes
Add body text explaining the recipes and the HTML structure
Link them together using the <a> tag
Insert appropriate images into the webpages
Apply alt text to the images
