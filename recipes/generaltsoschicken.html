    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Not actually general tso's chicken, but a modified form of the actual recipe. Substitutes oyster sauce for hoisin, and gochujang for chilli sauce. The trick is to absolutely dredge it in cornflour, so that when it is added to the sauce after being fried, it drinks it up and makes it extra-delicious!</p>
